/**
 * This package contains all necessary modules for implementing
 * an Artificial intelligence chess bot.
 *
 * Class {@link neointernship.web.client.player.bot.ai.ArtificialIntelligenceBot}
 * is presented as wrapper around the system.
 *
 * Class {@link neointernship.web.client.player.bot.ai.decisiontree.treecreation.DecisionTreeCreator}
 * contains main recursive ai-algorithm.
 *
 * The bot implementation based on the following algorithms and heuristics:
 *      - MiniMax decision rule
 *      - Alphaâ€“beta pruning
 *      - LVA/MVV
 *      - PST
 *      - Mathematical calculation of optimal figures values.
 *
 * This project was completed during the second month of the internship at Neolab company.
